# Contributing to bx24-template-mcp

`Last reviewed: 2026-06-13`

Thanks for considering a contribution. This document describes how to land code.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitrix24/templates-mcp.git
cd templates-mcp
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set NUXT_BITRIX24_WEBHOOK_URL and NUXT_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN
corepack enable    # this repo pins pnpm v11 (packageManager) — corepack installs the right version
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Verify the server is up:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

Open Nuxt DevTools (in the browser console it prints the URL) and pick the MCP Inspector tab to debug tools interactively.

## Branches

- Base branch is `main`.
- Feature branches: `feat/<short-name>`, `fix/<short-name>`, `docs/<short-name>`.
- Agent-authored branches: `claude/<short-name>-<random>`.
- No work directly on `main`. Branch protection enforces PR + green CI.

## Conventional Commits

All commits must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

Prefixes: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`, `refactor`, `ci`, `perf`, `build`, `revert`.
Optional scopes: `tools`, `client`, `auth`, `security`, `deploy`, `evals`, `skill`, `feedback`, `deps`, `docs`, `ci`, `tsconfig`, `lint`, `types`, `test`, `app`, `dxt`, `utils`.

Examples:

```
feat(tools): add list-task-comments
fix(client): handle 429 from Bitrix24 with exponential backoff
docs(adding-tools): clarify Zod describe step
chore(deps): bump @nuxtjs/mcp-toolkit to 0.15.3
ci: run evals only when DEEPSEEK_API_KEY secret is set
```

`commitlint` rejects invalid messages in CI.

## Pull Requests

- PR title must follow Conventional Commits — it is squashed into the commit message.
- Fill in every section of the PR template.
- Multiple commits per PR are fine. **Do not** rebase or force-push to an open PR.
- Don't mix unrelated changes — one concern per PR.
- Link the issue: `Closes #N` or `Refs #N`.
- Don't edit tracking labels in the template (`<!-- /track -->`).

### Before opening a PR

Run locally:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```

All three must pass. The CI re-runs them — and your PR will be blocked if anything fails.

### CI gates

On every PR:

1. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
2. `commitlint` checks PR title and every commit
3. `pnpm lint`
4. `pnpm typecheck`
5. `pnpm test` (unit; evals run only when `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` secret is present)
6. Integration tests run only when `NUXT_BITRIX24_TEST_WEBHOOK_URL` secret is present
7. `ShellCheck` for `scripts/*.sh` — **advisory**: findings are visible on the PR but do not block merge while the bash→TypeScript migration question (#163) is open. Reproduce locally with `shellcheck -x scripts/*.sh` if you touch a shell script.

> **CI authoring rule (closes #171, #179):** Never interpolate `${{ … }}` directly inside a `run:` block — GitHub substitutes the expression into the script source before the shell parses it, so a malicious PR title or comment can execute commands on the runner. Bind the value through `env:` and reference it with `$VAR` in the script body (see the `commitlint` and `build` jobs for the canonical shape). The same pattern applies to `vars.*` and `secrets.*` — even repo-controlled values benefit from env-binding for defence-in-depth and readability.
>
> **Primary defence: the `actionlint` + `zizmor` jobs (both blocking since #179).** They cover the full injection class — `${{ vars.* }}` / `${{ secrets.* }}` in scripts, multi-line `run: |` interpolation, mutable `uses:` refs, missing or over-broad `permissions:`, artifact/cache poisoning, dangerous triggers. `actionlint` owns workflow *correctness* (schema, expression validity, shellcheck on `run:` blocks); `zizmor` owns workflow *security* (template injection, credential persistence). They are complementary, not redundant — don't delete one as duplication (the rationale is captured in an ADR-style comment at the top of the analyser jobs in `ci.yml`). The earlier single-line regex guard in the `lint` job was removed in #179 once both analysers flipped to blocking — it had become a strict subset of what they enforce.
>
> **Secondary discipline (author-time):** the `env:`-binding pattern above is still the convention to write by hand, so a `run:` block reads safely at review time without waiting for the CI analysers to flag it.

Branch protection on `main` requires every gate green.

## Tests

Every code-bearing PR adds or updates tests. Three layers:

| Layer | Command | When |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | `pnpm test:unit` | Always |
| Integration | `pnpm test:integration` | When you change network behavior, requires `NUXT_BITRIX24_TEST_WEBHOOK_URL` (point at an isolated test portal — see Secrets) |
| Evals | `pnpm test:evals` | When you add or change a tool description, requires `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` |

See [`docs/EVALS.md`](./docs/EVALS.md) for the eval layer; the unit and integration layers are documented inline in their test files (`tests/unit/**`, `tests/integration/**`).

## Adding a new MCP tool

Short version:

1. Pick a group: `tasks` / `users` (or create a new group directory for your own entities — e.g. `crm` for the planned post-pilot deals/contacts/leads expansion, `calendars`, `disk`, `im`). The `meta/` directory is reserved for `bx24mcp_*` tools that do NOT call the Bitrix24 REST API; do not put Bitrix24-talking tools there.
2. Create `server/mcp/tools/<group>/<kebab-name>.ts` (file-based discovery).
3. Use `defineMcpTool({ name, description, inputSchema, handler })`.
4. Name pattern: `b24_<domain>(_<entity>)*_<action>` for Bitrix24 tools (action LAST, all tokens singular including before `_list` — see `skills/manage-bx24-template-mcp/adding-tools.md`); `bx24mcp_<verb>` for meta-tools (use ONLY for tools that don't call Bitrix24).
5. Every Zod field gets `.describe()` — the LLM reads it at runtime.
6. Call Bitrix24 via `useBitrix24Tenant()` (the OAuth-aware dispatcher in `~/server/utils/bitrix24-tenant`; falls back to the webhook singleton when OAuth is disabled — see `docs/OAUTH-DESIGN.md` §6). Never call `useBitrix24()` directly from a tool handler. Never bypass.
7. Add a unit test in `tests/unit/tools/<group>/<name>.test.ts` mocking `useBitrix24Tenant`.
8. Optionally add an eval case in `tests/evals/tool-selection.eval.ts`.
9. Commit: `feat(tools): add b24_<name>`.

Full template — including the `callV3` / `callV2` / `batchV2` / `batchV3` helpers, `AjaxError` handling, persona-walk checklist, and unit-test skeleton with `makeFakeBitrix24` — lives in [`skills/manage-bx24-template-mcp/adding-tools.md`](./skills/manage-bx24-template-mcp/adding-tools.md).

## Secrets

- Never commit secrets. `.env` is gitignored; `.env.example` is the contract.
- CI secrets live in GitHub Actions. Production secrets live in the server `.env` only.
- If you accidentally commit a secret: rotate it immediately, then open a PR removing it (history scrub is a separate operation).
- `NUXT_BITRIX24_TEST_WEBHOOK_URL` (locally) and `BITRIX24_TEST_WEBHOOK_URL` (GitHub Actions secret) must point at an isolated/staging Bitrix24 portal — the integration suite issues live REST calls and should never run against production data.
- The `Integration tests (Bitrix24)` CI job is informational: it is skipped on forks and emits a warning (not a failure) when the secret is absent, so do not promote it to a required status check.
- **Test env-var naming**: any variable a test needs to read from `.env` must use the `NUXT_BITRIX24_TEST_*` prefix (integration) or the `DEEPSEEK_*` prefix (evals). `vitest.config.ts` narrows Vite's `envPrefix` to exactly these families so production-shaped names you keep in `.env` for `pnpm dev` (`NUXT_BITRIX24_WEBHOOK_URL`, `NUXT_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, `NUXT_GITHUB_FEEDBACK_TOKEN`, …) never autoload into `process.env` during tests. Picking any other prefix means your test will silently see `undefined` locally and skip without a useful error. A CI step pins the `envPrefix` line so widening it back to a permissive `NUXT_*` fails the lint job (see #144).
- **Shell exports are NOT covered**: running `export NUXT_BITRIX24_WEBHOOK_URL=… && pnpm test:unit` still puts the value in `process.env` and bypasses the `envPrefix` guard. `tests/unit/mcp-stdio/shims.test.ts` defends against that one specific path with a per-case wipe of its known names — for any new test that reads sensitive `NUXT_*` directly, mirror that wipe.

## Dependency updates

[Renovate Bot](./renovate.json) handles routine updates.

- Patch + digest: auto-merged when CI is green.
- Minor (1.x+): manual review.
- Minor (0.x): manual review (semver pre-1.0 minor is breaking).
- Major: always manual review, `needs-review` label.
- `@bitrix24/b24jssdk*` and the MCP stack: always manual review.

Don't bypass Renovate by hand-editing `package.json` for routine bumps. Coordinated upgrades (multiple related packages) are fine — explain why in the PR.

## Reporting bugs and proposing features

- Bugs: open a [bug_report](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) issue.
- Features: open a [feature_request](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) issue.
- AI-agent feedback (issues found by automated callers): automatic via `bx24mcp_submit_feedback` — see [`docs/FEEDBACK.md`](./docs/FEEDBACK.md).

## Code of conduct

Be kind, be direct, assume good intent. No personal attacks. Maintainers reserve the right to close discussions that drift from the technical issue at hand.
