/**
 * Generic single-or-batch action factory used by every action-tool family.
 *
 * Current consumers:
 *   - `server/mcp/tools/deals/find-supplier.ts` — поиск поставщиков в CRM
 *   - `server/mcp/tools/deals/find-product.ts` — поиск товаров/номенклатуры
 *   - `server/mcp/tools/deals/find-contract.ts` — поиск договоров (смарт-инвойсов)
 *   - `server/mcp/tools/deals/create-deal.ts` — создание сделки на закупку
 *
 * All families share:
 *   1. The same input shape — a target id that's either a number
 *      (single-mode) or an array of ids (batch-mode), plus a `force` flag
 *      to override the batch cap.
 *   2. The same dispatch contract — single mode calls the action once;
 *      batch mode dispatches a single round-trip and returns a per-id
 *      summary `{ batch, verb, total, ok, failed, results }`.
 *   3. The same `BATCH_TOO_LARGE` error semantics.
 *
 * What differs per family lives in the spec callbacks (REST version, wire
 * params shape, response projection, optional pre-flight, confirm gates).
 * Each wrapper stays small and domain-focused while this file owns the
 * single-vs-batch dispatch + summary projection that used to drift
 * between families.
 *
 * Adding a new action-tool family means writing the runOne / runBatch
 * callbacks — the scaffold stays here.

The tool refuses with DELETE_NEEDS_CONFIRM if absent or `false`. Applies to BOTH single and batch — the confirm is per-call, not per-id; for batches, the operator must have agreed to the WHOLE batch (e.g. "удали записи 5, 7, 9" — three ids named aloud and confirmed).

 * sees a domain-specific message naming exactly what would be wiped. The

 *      Adding a new family without `force` would be a regression: Bitrix24
 *      batch caps could not be overridden by the agent, and the type error
